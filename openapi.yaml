    Trellix Intelligent Sandbox (Former: Advanced Threat Defense) provides an Application Programming Interface
    (API) framework for external applications to access core Trellix Intelligent Sandbox (former: ATD) functions through the REST protocol.
    
    REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It relies on a stateless, client-server and cacheable communication protocol – HTTP. It is an architecture style for designing networked applications. RESTful applications use HTTP requests to post data (create and/or update), get data (query information) and delete data. Thus, REST uses HTTP for all CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) operations. It is a lightweight alternative to mechanisms like RPC (Remote Procedure Calls) and Web Services such as SOAP and WSDL.
    
    **NOTE: Make sure to tweak the input parameters according to your organizational needs.**
