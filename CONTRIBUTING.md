## How to contribute

- Create a branch from the master with the following name convention: `{contributor-name}-short-description` or click the pen icon in a file to edit.
- Push the just created branch
- Create a Pull Request (PR) and push changes periodically (so everybody can track/review the progress of the contribution)
- Ask some reviewer to review and merge your changes when it is ready

Try to use the PR as main source of collaboration, keeping all discussion in the PR comments. 
Pushing frequently and asking for feedback will increase the chances to make a successful PR.

Thank you for you collaboration.
